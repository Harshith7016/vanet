You'll need a working installation of Veins [1] in order to run these simulations. This in turn relies on having the traffic simulator Sumo [2] as well as the network simulator Omnet++ [3] installed (including the INET Framework). Prior to running Veins simulations, a TCP connection between Sumo and Omnet++ needs to be established by running the python script 'sumo-launchd.py' (included with Veins).s
